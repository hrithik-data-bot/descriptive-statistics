    "<b>Measure of Central Tendency:-</b> A Measure of Central Tendency refers to a singular value or number that represents the center of a dataset, with all data points exhibiting an equal distance from this central point. There are three common metrics used to measure central tendency: the Mean, Median, and Mode.\n",

    "<b>Measure of Dispersion:-</b> A Measure of Dispersion denotes a value that illustrates the extent to which data is spread out from the central tendency or the variability within the data. It provides insights into the spread of the data. Two commonly used metrics to measure dispersion are the Standard Deviation and Variance."
